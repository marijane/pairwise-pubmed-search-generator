# ðŸ”Ž Pairwise PubMed Search Generator ðŸ”Ž

The Pairwise PubMed Search Generator is a web application for working around the truncation limitation in PubMedâ€™s proximity search. It simplifies the creation of two-concept proximity search strategies by eliminating the need to type out every variation by hand. Users enter two lists of terms, one for each concept, containing variations of each term. The tool does the rest, generating formatted PubMed search strings containing every pairwise combination of the two lists with the necessary search syntax, which can then be copied to the clipboard or launched in PubMed. In addition to generating proximity search strings, it can also combine a list of MeSH main headings with a list of subheadings and combine two lists of keyword terms in a traditional Boolean AND search.
